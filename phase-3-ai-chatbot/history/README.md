## Usage

### Updating Implementation Logs

Update the main implementation log (`implementation-logs/2026-01-13-phase-iii-ai-chatbot.md`) after completing each task:

1. Mark task as complete (✅)
2. Document what was done
3. List files created/modified
4. Note any issues encountered
5. Update next steps

### Recording Decisions

When making significant architectural or design decisions:

1. Create a new file in `decisions/phase-iii/`
2. Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-decision-title.md`
3. Include: context, options considered, decision made, rationale

### Adding Prompts

When creating new specifications or plans:

1. Add to `prompts/phase-iii/`
2. Format: `PHR-YYYYMMDD-NNN-description.md`
3. Include version control and timestamps
